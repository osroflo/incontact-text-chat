# InContact Text Chat
This is a code sample to show how to integrate the Patron InContact API with a SMS web service to create a text to chat environment using InContact call center software.
This API is really useful and practical because  it allow people, who do not have access to a computer (or smartphone),  to get referrals for services.

#### Brief Explanation
Basically the process starts when a client texts some keyword to a short code number. The API will send that text message to the InContact system where it is an agent getting all the messages in a Chat interface.

#### How to install?
This is just a sample code. It is needed to have the sql to create the database, and the SMS library to communicate with the cloud service.
